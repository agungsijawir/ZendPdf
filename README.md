# ZendPdf component

Note: this fork is being maintained since the original has been abandoned. The primary purpose is to add support for AcroForms (PDF forms and fields).

> ## ABANDONED
>
> This package is no longer maintained. We recommend [TCPDF](https://tcpdf.org/) as a replacement.

## Installation
Run the command:

```bash
composer require "rightsourcecompliance/zendpdf": "~2.0.4"
```

At that point, follow the instructions in the documentation folder for actual
usage of the component.
